## Submit an assignment the 401 way!

Basic steps for all assignments:

1. Fork this repository _to your own github account_
1. Clone your forked repo locally (`git clone ...`)
1. Start a branch (`git checkout -b dev`)
1. Repeat until done:
  * Do work
  * Make commits
  * Push to your github
1. Submit PR from `<your repo>/<your branch>` to `<class repo>/<branch-with-your-username>`
1. Verify that PR passes Travis CI
1. Submit PR Url and:
  * reflection (what happened? how was it?)
  * questions and follow-on interest
  
For this assignment:

* Work is to create a single js file that logs a message like:

    ```
    console.log('hello world!');
    ```

* You can skip `Verify that PR passes Travis CI` for this assignment only!
